I cannot know if we have anything beyond this life. 

Many before me have commented on the fleeting nature of life - that nothing is promised to us but this moment and those that came before it. 

To think about what it means to 'live' or to think about 'life' inevitably leads to an exploration of 'death.' Or simply the end of life. 

But I won't go there in this post. 

I named this site Momentaryan for the rather simple word play of 'momentary' and my first name, Ryan. I do not expect my words (or my 'life,' for that matter) to leave any significant impact on the universe once my life has ended. Realizing this and considering that possibility, not just for ourselves, but everyone we know and all of humanity and life, can be freeing... or liberating. 

In the time scales of Everything, our time alive is rather brief. It is momentary. I try to remind myself of this often. I believe doing so can help me live a more purposeful and meaningful life. Maybe it can for others too.
