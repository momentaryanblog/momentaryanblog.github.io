	<h1>About.</h1>
	
	<p>It seems like more and more people are starting to carve out their own places on the web. To be honest I know very little about web design or computer science. I have come accross creations of others and done my best to follow in their footprints (I copied them).</p>
	<p>I am just a guy from the PNW that thinks about random stuff and wanted a place to jot some ideas down. Maybe this can be that place.</p>
	
	<p>Stuff will go in the <a href=/blog>blog</a></p> for now.</p>
	<p>Not sure if I want people to contact me... I'm sure some computer wizards out there already know how to do that anyway, but anywho maybe I'll add some means of contacting me here later.</p>
